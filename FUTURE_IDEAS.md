## Future Releases
These are our plans for future releases

### Profile
Moreover, users have their own profile. They can review texts they have written (based on category), edit them, and they are sorted in chronological order (the category with the newest text is first, then the category that has the newest text from all other categories, and so on). Moreover, they have to select in which language they write their texts. (By default it is the language they use the app.) Lastly, they will select form which languages they want to receive texts, if they at some point choose to share texts with other persons. (see section "Future Releases")

### Languages
The app will be available in English and German, hopefully Ukrainian, too.

### Auto-save
In the future, texts will be saved while writing (so that you do not loose anything if internet connection is lost). You just click finish.

### Collage-mode
Moreover, there will an additional very cool mode called collage with three sub-modes. MZ has the ideas in his Evernote.

### Chatting and sharing stories
Moreover, writers will be able to get in touch with other writers, if they share a text with at least 100 words with another random person (anonymously, and they can exchange user names, if they want to). By default, we will try to match the user with the most recent shareable text written with the same prompt in the same language. If there is none with this prompt within the last four weeks, we will find the most recent shareable text from this sub-mode. If there is none within this sub-mode within the last four weeks, we will give the most recent shareable text from this mode. If there is none within this mode for the last four weeks, we will present the most recent shareable text from our data base.

Users can add other fellow writers and follow them and see if they have submitted a text within the last 24 hours, 3 days, week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, or longer.

And in his/her profile the person will be able to select texts as “private” or “shared with friends”.

### Profile Picture
Writers will have the ability to add a profile picture.
