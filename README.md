# MiZaWra
*the home for writers, journalers, and others*

## First Release
MiZaWra is a minimalistic-designed writing app - providing various kinds of prompts to its users, if they want it. Users can login and then select different modes to write: 

### Modes
- **Free Journaling** 
This mode leads directly to writing mode. You write your own journal, with a small timer (Default: 15 Minutes - if you change it, next time it will be set to this default. After the time, a not too aggressive sound (like birds) reminds you that it is time to get to an end; the timer functionality can be turned off, too) and what you have written will be saved with the date as soon as you click save. 

- **Prompted Journaling**  
This mode has three sub-modes: 
  - Positive (you get positive prompts that will try to make you think about positive stuff) 
  - Neutral (Reflections about yourself, your previous life, your current life, your family - of course that might not be neutral)
  - Philosophical (reflecting some more philosophical questions, like: What is time? Why is there anything rather than nothing? Who is you - the one who thinks or the one you are thinking about when you are thinking of yourself? If there is a god, what is He/She/It like? ) 
  - (Negative (this mode will face negative moments — I’d say, let’s skip this mode for now))
  
- **Prompts for Writing Stories**
This mode has three sub-modes: 
  - Stimulus Story - Word (you get a prompt word, and you should write a story about it) 
  - Stimulus Story - Words (you get a few words, and you should write a story that contains all of these words)
  - Stimulus Story - Paragraph (you get a few sentences, and you should write a story about it/ expand what is written there - feel free to change it completely on the way) 

### Profile
Moreover, users have their own profile. They can review texts they have written (based on category), edit them, and they are sorted in chronological order (the category with the newest text is first, then the category that has the newest text from all other categories, and so on). Moreover, they have to select in which language they write their texts. (By default it is the language they use the app.) Lastly, they will select form which languages they want to receive texts, if they at some point choose to share texts with other persons. (see section "Future Releases") 

### Languages
The app will be available in English and German, hopefully Ukrainian, too. 

## Future Releases
These are our plans for future releases

### Auto-save
In the future, texts will be saved while writing (so that you do not loose anything if internet connection is lost). You just click finish. 

### Collage-mode
Moreover, there will an additional very cool mode called collage with three sub-modes. MZ has the ideas in his Evernote. 

### Chatting and sharing stories
Moreover, writers will be able to get in touch with other writers, if they share a text with at least 100 words with another random person (anonymously, and they can exchange user names, if they want to). By default, we will try to match the user with the most recent shareable text written with the same prompt in the same language. If there is none with this prompt within the last four weeks, we will find the most recent shareable text from this sub-mode. If there is none within this sub-mode within the last four weeks, we will give the most recent shareable text from this mode. If there is none within this mode for the last four weeks, we will present the most recent shareable text from our data base. 

Users can add other fellow writers and follow them and see if they have submitted a text within the last 24 hours, 3 days, week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, or longer. 

And in his/her profile the person will be able to select texts as “private” or “shared with friends”. 

### Profile Picture
Writers will have the ability to add a profile picture.
